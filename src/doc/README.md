This repository contains the result data of our study investigating the relationship
between emission peaks and economic crises. The repository contains mainly two datasets:

* `multiplicative-contributions.csv / .nc`
* `prepost-growth-rates.csv / .nc`

Both datasets exist in CSV and NetCDF file format for convenience. The dataset
`multiplicative-contributions` contains year-to-year change factors of GDP, population, energy-
intensity, and carbon-intensity for every country in our study. The dataset
`prepost-growth-rates` contains growth over a multi-year period pre- and post- crisis for each
country and each crises in our study.
